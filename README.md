# RGBLEDcontroller-arduinoNano
RGB LED Controller based on an Arduino Nano

This code generates three individual PWM channels for control of an RGB LED, or other applications where a PWM control signal is desirable.

I chose groups of three pins on each side of the microcontroller for the RGB signals, both input and output. Pins A0-A2 for inputs and D9-D11 for outputs. However, these can easily be changed if desired and the Arduino Nano is capable of even more PWM channels if need be.
